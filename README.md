# NumberWizardUI

A binary search game. Choose a number in the given range, then the engine will try to predict it. In a finite number of guesses, it will find your number by repeatedly asking you if the currently predicted number is higher or lower than your number. A better version of the previous game, this one comes with a graphical interface, instead of only displaying messages in the Unity log. 

Not an original project, inspired by the following Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/

Made with Unity, Visual Studio, in C#.
